## Ethics <a name="ethics"></a>
### What is ethics in software engineering? <a name="ethics.1"></a>
Ethics, as defined by the Dictionary, mean a system of morals. If you where to apply ethics to software engineering, it could be question of whether to make a message notification intrusive or not visible at all, whether to ask for you to register an account to use certain features or to make them unrestricted. 
Even though these examples have a direct impact on the user experience, that isn’t always the case. A good example of this is user data. You could very easily ask your users to share a bunch of data with you by signing up or accepting cookies, even though the data is not necessary to the user experience. 
All in all, ethics in software engineering is about morals in combinations with software engineering. This could be as small as crediting a git repo or as big as user data gathering.
### Why is ethics important in software engineering? <a name="ethics.2"></a>
As stated previously, ethics are in direct relation with morals. Any choice a software engineer makes will have an impact on the user. Whether you change the layout of an interface or choose a cheaper host for his online application.

### What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? <a name="ethics.3"></a>
A good guideline to work ethically as a software engineer is to follow the <a href="https://ethics.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code/">ACM Software Engineering Code</a>. The code lays a good groundwork with comprehensive and detailed principles. These principles are as followed:
1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
